= BitPack: Library for packing and unpacking binary strings

BitPack is a library that provides an easy to use API for packing and
unpacking arbitrary binary strings.  Unlike Array#pack and String#unpack,
BitPack objects allow you to pack and unpack fields of arbitrary bit lengths.

= Installing BitPack

Get BitPack from RubyForge.

  $ gem install bitpack

= Example

In this example, we will see how to pack and unpack a contrived message format.

The format is as follows:

* field +foo+: unsigned integer, 3 bits in length
* field +bar+: unsigned integer, 13 bits in length
* field +baz+: octet string, +bar+ bytes in length


   require 'rubygems'
   require 'bitpack'
   
   class Message
     attr_accessor :foo, :bar, :baz
     def initialize(foo=nil, bar=nil, baz=nil)
       @foo = foo
       @bar = bar
       @baz = baz
     end
   
     def pack
       # create a new BitPack object to pack the message into
       bp = BitPack.new
   
       # pack field foo into 3 bits
       bp.append_bits(@foo, 3)
   
       # pack field bar into 13 bits
       bp.append_bits(@bar, 13)
   
       # finally, pack baz as a string
       bp.append_bytes(@baz)
   
       # convert the BitPack to a string
       bp.to_bytes
     end
   
     def self.unpack(bytes)
       m = self.new
   
       # create a new BitPack from the packed message string
       bp = BitPack.from_bytes(bytes)
   
       # unpack field foo from the first 3 bits
       m.foo = bp.read_bits(3)
   
       # unpack field bar from the next 13 bits
       m.bar = bp.read_bits(13)
   
       # finally, unpack the string baz from the next bar bytes 
       m.baz = bp.read_bytes(m.bar)
   
       m
     end
   end
   
   m1 = Message.new
   m1.foo = 5
   s = "BitPack makes packing and unpacking binary strings easy!"
   m1.bar = s.length
   m1.baz = s
   
   bytes = m1.pack
   
   p bytes
     #=> "\2408BitPack makes packing and unpacking binary strings easy!"
   
   m2 = Message.unpack(bytes)
   p m2.foo
     #=> 5
   p m2.bar
     #=> 56
   p m2.baz
     #=> "BitPack makes packing and unpacking binary strings easy!"


= Notes

BitPack is almost entirely implemented as a C library.  If you would like to
use BitPack from a C program, just grab the <tt>bitpack.c</tt> and <tt>bitpack.h</tt> files from
the <tt>ext/</tt> directory of the gem and include them in your project.  Documentation
can be found in <tt>bitpack.h</tt> and example usage can be seen in <tt>test/bitpack_tests.c</tt>.
